Introduction
CatBoost is a popular gradient boosting algorithm developed by Yandex. It is particularly known for handling categorical features automatically, providing robust performance without extensive preprocessing.

This notebook provides an end-to-end example of using CatBoost for a classification task, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed to run the notebook:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
catboost
seaborn
matplotlib
Dataset

Dataset
This data set contains 13 clinicopathologic features aiming to predict recurrence of well differentiated thyroid cancer. The data set was collected in duration of 15 years and each patient was followed for at least 10 years.

Notebook Overview
1. Import Libraries
The notebook begins by importing the necessary libraries for data handling, machine learning, and visualization.

2. Load Dataset
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and the first few rows are displayed to understand its structure.

3. Data Preprocessing
The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y), and then into training and testing sets.

4. Model Training
The CatBoost Classifier is initialized and trained on the training data.

5. Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the training and validation loss (Logloss) are extracted and plotted to visualize the training progress.

6. Visualization
Various visualizations are generated, including:
-Count plots for categorical features.
-Training and validation loss over iterations.

Results
The notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the CatBoost model's performance, including metrics and visualizations. The key results include accuracy, F1-score, and loss plots, which help in understanding the model's effectiveness and training behavior.
